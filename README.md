# Inventroy Management System

In this project I had to design and creat an Inventory Management System, which asks for user 
input to do CRUD actions. SQL database is used, hosted on localhost. I used the provided IMS - starter file which helped me through 
implementation. I used JAVA as my coding language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need the latest version of Eclipse, Apache Maven and SQL

### Installing

Download IMS-Starter-0.0.1-with-dependencies.jar -> Search -> CMD -> run command line -> 
navigate to where the file was downloaded -> execute 'java -jar 
ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -> done

### Unit Tests 

Testing covers 70% of the project: Tests the database, connection, Customer, Item, Order, 
OrderItem, All the Controllers for these classes and and the used DAOs. It is 15 testing files,
